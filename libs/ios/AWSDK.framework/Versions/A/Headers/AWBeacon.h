 @brief		The Beacon service is used to send a heartbeat message to AirWatch.
 @details	AWBeacon represent an AirWatch beacon object. Beacon represent static kind of device data like IP Address,MAC Address etc. AWBeacon manage Beacon operation. By using AWBeacon we can start communicating to server and send Beacon to server.

/** 
 This method will initialize the Beacon with basic values to begin with. All other values can be manually set.
 
 @param token This is a required APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) token that will be used for communication between the app and the server.
 @param interval This is a required time interval (in seconds) that specify how often a beacon should be send to the server
 @param locationGroup An optional value that can be used to send user's location group to the server
 @param locationMode An optional value, if enabled, will allow the beacon to be sent to the server even when the app is in background.
 @param distanceFilter Ano optional value to specify how often to update the user's location. For best result, the distance should not be less then 25 meters. The default value is 50 meters.
