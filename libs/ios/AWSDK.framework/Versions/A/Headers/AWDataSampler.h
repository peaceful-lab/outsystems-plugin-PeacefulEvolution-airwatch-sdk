 @brief		AWDataSampler is utility kind of interface, by using this user can send dynamic data of device, like system info, analytics info, GPS info, callLog info, usage info, usageData info etc.
 @details	AWDataSampler declares the programmatic interface for an object that manages the SDK‚Äôs DataSampler module. AWDataSampler declares methods for starting and stopping the AWDataSampler service on a device. Settings for the DataSampler is passed through a configuration object of type AWDataSamplerConfiguration. Using the configuration object, the user can stop and start various DataSampler modules. To set up DataSampler module, user has to initialize the DataSampler module instance with a configuration object and then start the module by calling the method startUp:outError on DataSampler module instance. Calling shutDown:outError on the DataSampler module instance will stop sampling and transmission.
