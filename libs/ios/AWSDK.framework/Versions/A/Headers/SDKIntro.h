/*! \mainpage Introduction
 
 * The AirWatch Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools allowing organizations to
 * incorporate a host of features and functionality into their custom-built iOS applications. The AirWatch
 * SDK enhances the security and functionality of those applications and in turn helps save application 
 * development time and money.
 
 * Integrating an application with the AirWatch SDK can be broken down into five main steps.
 
 *
 * <b> Enable the Core SDK Framework within Xcode </b>
 *
 * - Add Required Frameworks \n
 * - Configure the Server Connections \n
 * - Implement the Command Processors \n
 * - Implement the Beacon \n
 * - Implement the DataSampler \n\n
 
 * Detailed explaination about each step can be found in AirWatch iOS SDK Technical Implementation Guide.
